A famous quote by Yoda

> For my ally is the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It’s energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you…me…the tree…the rock…everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship.

Cooking Recipe: Apple Cinnamonn Pancakes
----------------------------------------

### Ingredients

-   3/4 cup milk
-   1 1/2 tablespoons vinegar
-   1 cup flour
-   3 tablespoons sugar
-   1 teaspoon cinnamon (if you really love cinnamon you can add another 1/2 teaspoon)
-   1 teaspoon baking powder
-   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1 egg
-   2 tablespoons oil

##### Apple Topping

-   2 tablespoons butter
-   2 apples, peeled, cored, and diced
-   2 tablespoons brown sugar
-   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
-   1/3 cup maple syrup

#### Special Kitchen Tools

-   skillet
-   large bowl
-   small bowl
-   pan

#### Steps

1.  Preheat a skillet to medium-high heat (275 degrees).
2.  Whisk together the milk and vinegar and allow to rest for 5 minutes.
3.  While milk is curdling, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
4.  Whisk egg and oil into milk. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir until combined (don't over-mix, it should still have some lumps).
5.  Spray skillet with cooking spray. Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to pour batter onto skillet. Cook about 2 minutes until bubbles form and the edges start to look "dry". Use a spatula to flip the pancake and cook another 1-2 minutes on the other side. Set pancakes aside and repeat with remaining batter.
6.  Add butter, apples, brown sugar, and cinnamon to a medium sauce pan. Stir over medium heat 3-5 minutes until apples are very tender. Stir in syrup. Serve apple topping over warm pancakes.

Euclidean Distance
------------------

### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them (**$\\overline{pq}$**).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
$$
\\begin{align}
d(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q}) =d(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p})
&=\\sqrt{(q\_{1}-p\_{1})^2+(q\_{2}-p\_{2})^2+\\cdots+(q\_{n}-p\_{n})^2}\\\\
&=\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^n(q\_{i}-p\_{i})^2}.
\\end{align}
$$
 The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$\\|\\mathbf{p}\\|=\\sqrt{(p\_{1}^2+p\_{1}^2+\\cdots+p\_{n}^2}=\\sqrt{\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}}$$
 where the last expression involves the dot product.
